nxgipd v1.1.1beta
=================

nxgipd is a monitoring daemon for UTC Interlogix/GE Security/Caddx NetworX
series alarm systems that use the NetworX NX-584 protocol.

Daemon process requires very minimal memory and CPU resource making it suitable
to be run in on almost any hardware that runs Linux (or feel free to port 
this to your favorite OS :-)
nxgipd daemon process is meant to continuously monitor the alarm panel and
log any activity into local log file and/or to syslog.
Daemon process can run designated script as response to different events
(such as alarm, zone tripped, etc.), making it easy to perform custom
actions or monitor the alarm yourself.

Command line tools nxstat and nxcmd allow real-time polling of the alarm
status and interact with the alarm.

NOTE! Before you can use this program you typically need to first install 
NX-584E (home automation) module or enable built-in serial port (NX-8E panel).
If you don't know the program code (PIN) for your panel, you may need to get
your alarm provider to do this for you.

This program does not interfere with alarm monitoring services, so it can be 
used on systems monitored by a third-party (as additional means of monitoring
the alarm system). 
Alternatively, this program could be used to build "DIY" monitoring solution
withouth requiring a third party monitoring provider.



SUPPORTED ALARM PANEL MODELS

	NX-4 (V2)
	NX-6 (V2)
	NX-8 (V2)
	NX-8E 
	CS575 (Aritech)

	Other panels that use same "NetworX NX-584 RS-232 Gateway
	Interface Protocol" should work fine as well (NX-10, CS275,
        CS375, CS875, ...)


REQUIREMENTS
	Mini-XML library (libmxml) v2.6 or later version


TESTED PLATFORMS
	Linux (Debian)
	OpenBSD


INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, run configure,  make necessary changes to the Makefile,  
	and then compile the program. You may want do something like this:

		tar xzvf nxgipd-1.1.0.tar.gz
		cd nxgipd-1.1.0
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install

	Then copy included nxgipd.conf template to /etc/nxgipd.conf and update
        it to match your setup.


SERIAL INTERFACE CONFIGURATION

       For this program to work, the NX-584 interface module (or the built-in 
       serial port in NX-8E) must be configured first. For detailed 
       instructions on how to do that, see the corresponding installation manuals.

       Recommended configuration settings:

       - Protocol: ASCII

       - Speed: 9600 Baud 

       - Enabled Transision Messages:
       	 	 * Interface Configuration Message
		 * Zone Status Message
		 * Partition Status Message
		 * System Status Message
		 * Log Event Message
		 * Keypad Message Received (OPTIONAL)
		 * X-10 Message Received (OPTIONAL)

       - Enabled Commands:
       	 	 * Interface Configuration Request
		 * Zone Name Request
		 * Zone Status Request
		 * Zones Snapshot Request
		 * Partition Status Request
		 * Partitions Snapshot Request
		 * Send X-10 Message (OPTIONAL)
		 * Log Event Request
		 * Send Keypad Text Message (OPTIONAL)
		 * System Status Request 
		 * Program Data Request (OPTIONAL)
		 * Program Data Command (OPTIONAL)
		 * Set Clock / Calendar Command
		 * Primary Keypad Function with PIN (OPTIONAL)
		 * Secondary Keypad Function (OPTIONAL)
		 * Zone Bypass Toggle (OPTIONAL)
		 


HISTORY
	v1.1.1beta
		- new -r option to nxstat command
		- fix to binary protocol support
		- minor bug fixes	
        v1.1.0  - new configuration setting 'savestatus' to specify status file
